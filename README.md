## Comments

### Team Player Attitude
To improve or expand this task, I would collaborate with teammates by discussing additional test cases, ensuring we cover edge cases. I’d also review the logic together, share feedback on improvements, and incorporate suggestions effectively.

### If I had more time
- Implement more robust validation tests, ensuring that incorrect data inputs are properly rejected.
- Expand test coverage to include cases like duplicate superhero names or invalid humility scores.

### Humility and Communication
Clear explanations in comments and documentation ensure maintainability and collaboration among team members. I’d welcome feedback to refine these tests further.
